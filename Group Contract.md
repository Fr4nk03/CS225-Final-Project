# Team Contract

## Communication (Discord)
1. **Team Meetings** 
Because three of us live in the same apartment building, it's easy to meet up and cooperate with each other. We are planning to meet at least 3 to 4 times a week. Most of our meetings will be hosted in person and last for 30 minutes to 1 hour. One member will be responsible for taking notes for each meeting.

2. **Assistance** 
If anyone has a problem, he can post the question in the group chat and whenever the others have time, they should help him with the problem and find spare time to discuss it together. This should normally be done within 24 hours.

3. **Respect** 
Don't be afraid to raise questions! Everyone should pay respection to others because we are in the same team. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We can divide into two sub-groups: one group focuses on the main structure and the other fills in the detailed implementation. If any group has questions, members should always ask for help and try to cooperate with the maximum efficiency.

5. **Time Commitment** 
Each week, a minimum of 4-6 hours are expected for each group member. If anyone has a large amount of homework due that week, they should finish their homework efficiently and then devote themselves to the project. Whenever someone can't come to the meeting, he should notify others in the group chat in advance. Moreover, he needs to catch up with the team to make sure he can keep up with the group process.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
When s conflict arises, we will first try to resolve in our own group by making the specific point where conflict happens clear and having enough communication by raising potential solutions to the conflict. If the conflict still cannot be resolved, we will find our mentor for help.
